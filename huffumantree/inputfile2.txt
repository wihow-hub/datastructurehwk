There's something down there. It's Gollum.
Gollum?
He's been following us for three days.
He escaped the dungeons of Baraddur?
Escaped,or was set loose.Now the Ring has brought him here.He will never be rid of his need for it.He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself.Smeagol's life is a sad story.Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before the Ring found him.Before it drove him mad.
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
Pity?It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life.Can you give it to them, Frodo?Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.Even the very wise can not see all ends.My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill,before this is over.The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
I wish the Ring had never come to me.I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide.All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.In which case, you also were meant to have it.
